# DS634_Final
Water Potability Project for DS634 final.

This project focuses on binary classification to determine the potability of water samples. It utilizes various machine learning models, including K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Bidirectional LSTM, to classify water samples as either potable or non-potable. The project also includes an exploration of performance metrics such as True Positive Rate (TPR), Specificity (SPC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and others to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.
